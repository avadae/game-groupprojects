# Application process

To apply simply start by writing an e-mail to [Alex Vanden Abeele](mailto:alex.vanden.abeele@howest.be), who will contact you for a first intake meeting. Duting this meeting we'll discuss your project, your needs and your end goal to match it with our own needs and goals for our projects.

For each submitted project we need the info requested in this document. The deadline to enter the document is always the end of August, but we advise to submit it earlier to give us time to review it and contact you if there are additional questions.
