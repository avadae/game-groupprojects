# The timeline

We start mid september and end mid december. Students work 4 days a week on the project during 11 weeks in total. They work on campus in "the Hive", in close collaboration with supervisors and coaches.

# The process

we execute the project in three phases

## Prototype phase

During the first, so-called prototype phase the students brainstorm on concepts and ideas and create small quick prototypes to validate the various options. The end product of this phase is a final prototype that illustrates what the end product will entail. During this phase there is close collaboration with client, we iterate on these various ideas until a final concept is approved.
