Every academic year during the first semester, students of the majors Game Development, Game Graphics Production, Independent Game Production and Game Sound Integration work in teams of 5-6 people on a game project.

Students have the opportunity to propose their own projects or they can contribute to a project proposed by a company or an organization. The project should be a game, but it can also be a serious game or a project applying game specific technology.
