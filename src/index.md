Every academic year during the first semester, students at [Howest - Digital arts and entertainment](https://www.digitalartsandentertainment.be/) of the majors Game Development, Game Graphics Production, Independent Game Production and Game Sound Integration work in teams of 5-6 people on a game project.

Students have the opportunity to propose their own projects or they can contribute to a project proposed by a company or an organization. The project should be a game, but it can also be a serious game or a project applying game specific technology.

Here are some examples from previous years

Not only are our own students placed on these projects, we also work with students from the [Royal Conservatoire of Antwerp](https://www.ap-arts.be/en/royal-conservatoire-antwerp), the [Royal Conservatoire of Ghent](https://schoolofartsgent.be/en) and the [Royal Conservatoire of Brussels](https://www.conservatoire.be/en/) for the music of our projects and students from the [Royal Institute for Theather, Cinema and Sound](https://www.ritcs.be/nl/) who write the stories for some of our projects.

Read more about our development process [here](process.html) and if you're interested in working with our students read more about our application process [here](apply.html).

Many of our student projects can also be found on [itch.io](https://digitalartsentertainment.itch.io/) and [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/dae)!
