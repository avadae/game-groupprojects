## Timeline

We start mid September and end mid December. Students work 4 days a week on the project during 11 weeks in total. They work on campus in "the Hive", in close collaboration with supervisors and coaches.

## The process

we execute the project in three phases

### Prototype phase

During the first, so-called prototype phase the students brainstorm on concepts and ideas and create small quick prototypes to validate the various options. The end product of this phase is a final prototype that illustrates what the end product will entail. During this phase there is close collaboration with the client. We iterate on these various ideas until a final concept is approved.

This phase typically takes around 3-4 weeks, depending on the demands of the project.

### Production phase

In the production phase we don't need the client as much, this is where we do our thing: we develop the game. Of course there are regular meetings with the client (once every two weeks for example) where the students present the progress to the client, feedback can then be given and applied. Here our supervisors guide them through the production process.

Development of the game happens with a certain game engine, typically we use either Unreal or Unity depending on the project requirements, but others (like Godot) are certainly possible. We use [Perforce](https://www.perforce.com/) for our source control needs and keep track of the planning in [Hack 'n Plan](https://hacknplan.com/).

### Polish phase

In the last two weeks the students are forbidden to add any new feature to the game, instead they focus on perfecting the features that have been implemented. This way we end up with a polished product and not a messy pile of unfinished features.

## Testing

Each year we have a testing day where we take the project outside and have the general public come and playtest our games. This always is an eye-opener for the students and provides with valuable, real-life feedback. In the past we've been a guest at [Arhus](https://www.arhus.be/) in Roeselare and the [Mind and Makerspace](https://mindandmakerspace.com/) in Brugge.
