The Province of West Flanders organized  three editions of the Festival of the Future between 2021 and 2024. On the occasion of the festive opening of the renovated [Provincial Court](https://www.provinciaalhof.be), the last edition of "a festival of the future" called ‘Over-Morgen’ took place.

The challenge for the students was to imagine what the animal world would be like in the future and how will humans and animals co-exist? Robot Animals or MechAnimals will be created to co-exist with animals and humans. Mechanimals will integrate into the animal’s habitat and clean up nature without disrupting it.

The gameplay for this game was kept simple to allow visitors easily grasp the controls and play through the entire project. The player controls a mechanic otter swimming through the canals of Bruges, cleaning it up as he goes.

The game is called [OtterWorldly and can be played on itch.io](https://sedesdecock.itch.io/mechanimals)

The music for this game was composed by [Maurick Reuser](https://maurickreuser.nl/), a student at the [royal conservatoire of Antwerp](https://www.ap-arts.be/en/royal-conservatoire-antwerp).
