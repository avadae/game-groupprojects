[Hulpverleningszone Fluvia](https://www.hvzfluvia.be/) is the local fire department here in Kortrijk. As a public fire service they have various tasks towards the community. Bringing safety messages and teaching children how to act in case of fire is one of those tasks.

Last year we already partnered with Fluvia and created the game "Fire Escape", which is now in active use during safety sessions. In the game you're a student and need to escape the burning school building in a safe manner. You can request such a session via [this website](https://www.fire-escape.be/).

With the success of the last project in mind, this year we've build a second game called "Fire @ Home" that now aims to teach childeren and adults alike about the safety hazards at home. In the game you first take as much precautions as you can and when the fire finally breaks out, you need to escape with your child and call the fire brigade.

This game was made by Alexandre Beeckmans, Nicolas Feroumont, Gwynne Aloy, Silvia Raponi and Maaren Maes
